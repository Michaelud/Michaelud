                    different subjects together. While many will offer core topics with a choice of modules, it is
                    important to remember that there is no national curriculum at degree level and course content can
                    vary significantly. Choosing a degree subject isn't the same as choosing a degree course; the

                There is a wide number of science-related careers you can enter with a biological science degree.
                Additionally, some careers require a relevant postgraduate qualification. The key areas of

                <h3>What is software engineering?</h3>
                <p class="p-3 text-justify">You can’t go far without using software. From the alarm that wakes you up,
                    the car you drive to
                    work in, to the laptop you use when you arrive, it’s almost impossible to avoid. Not that you’d want
                    to, because software is an integral part of almost every device that makes your daily life easier.
                    Mobile phones, computers, home appliances, public transportation, and the emergency services
                    all rely on intelligent software to make the most of their technology.
                <h6>Software engineering course entry requirements</h6>
                Computing and IT are the most important subjects to study, but other technical subjects like
                physics and design technology may also be useful. What you’re really looking to show is your
                attention to detail, a technical curiosity, and a natural talent with numbers and programmes.
                A good software engineer is diligent and analytical, able to trouble-shoot, and solve problems on
                the spot. These are the kind of attributes you’ll want to show in your personal statement,
                especially as many software engineering degrees will involve an interview.<br>
                <h6>What can you do with a software engineering degree?</h6>
                Software engineering graduates will typically go on to find employment in the following areas:
                And many more options:

                <ul>

                <h3>What is Antropology?</h3>
                <p class="p-3 text-justify">Anthropology is the study of how human beings live in the world. It is most
                    commonly taught in
                    the UK in one of two strands:
                <ol>
                    <li>Social Antropology</li>
                    <li>Biological Antropology</li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Antropology course entry requirements</h6>
                Entry requirements to study anthropology courses can vary, due to the fact that students aren't
                often expected to have studied it prior to applying. Interested applicants should check specific
                requirements of any course or provider they may wish to apply to.
                Some universities can also offer a foundation year, which could be beneficial if you don't meet their
                usual entry requirements.<br>
                <h6>What is it like to study Antropology</h6>
                Well, you know the expression about jumping down the rabbit hole? Consider the fact that rabbits
                have burrows, made up of innumerable interconnected tunnels, that can stretch on, and on, and
                on... Studying anthropology can be likened to getting lost in these tunnels forever, and seeing
                where all the connections lie.
                As such, the potential for your studies is almost infinite. And anthropology as a field of study is
                connected to almost every other subject in often surprising and interesting ways, allowing you
                scope to pair it with other passions and interests.
                Over the course of your anthropology degree, you're likely to cover aspects of physics, chemistry,
                biology, philosophy, art, music, economics, mathematics, mythology, history, linguistics, and even
                more. So, if there is another subject in particular that you're enthusiastic about, you can potentially
                bring that pairing to an independent study.

                    disciplines including, for example, animal and land management, food
                    science, economics, horticulture, technology, and environmental
                    conservation.
                <h6>Entry Requirements</h6>
                A levels – To get on to a related degree, you will usually need a minimum of two A levels, with
                three A levels and A/B grades required for the most popular courses. Entry requirements range
                from BBB to BCC, with the universities and colleges most commonly asking for CCC. Most degrees
                in this field ask for at least one science A level (biology is often required for degrees in animal
                science and veterinary nursing), with two preferred by many. It is important to check precise
                requirements with universities, as some are more flexible around which subjects they regard as a
                science.
                Scottish Highers – Entry requirements for Highers (the most common qualification) range from
                BBBC to ABBBB, with universities or colleges most frequently requiring BBBB. Occasionally,
                universities ask for Advanced Highers to supplement Highers. If Advanced Highers are requested,
                universities or colleges typically ask for AB.
                Vocational courses – Other Level 3/Level 6 qualifications (e.g. Pearson BTEC Level 3 National
                Extended Diploma in Animal Management Science, SVQ Animal Care (SCQF Level 6)) may be
                accepted as an alternative to A levels/Highers by some providers. It’s essential that you check
                alternative entry requirements with universities or colleges

                    When it comes to subjects, you’ll almost certainly need maths, chemistry, and physics in your
                    application. Other subjects which will help you may include further maths, statistics, design

                <p><h6>What’s it like to study chemical engineering?</h6>
                    Chemical engineering is a challenging degree. You’ll most likely be studying for three years to earn
                    a BSc or BEng, but many courses will include a sandwich year or industry placement, making them
                    four years.
                    You’ll spend around 20 hours per week in lectures or labs during your degree, which is more than
                    most. You can also expect a high amount of self-study, as chemical engineering will introduce you
                    to many subjects, topics and principles. If you’re planning on taking advantage of the industry
                    placement opportunity in chemical engineering degrees, be prepared to work 40 hour weeks.
                    As you start your course, you’ll be building a foundation of knowledge in the subject, so expect a
                    lot of introductory modules which span chemistry, physics, and maths. You’ll begin to specialise in
                    the second and third years, as you understand more about chemical engineering as a science.
                    And you’ll be developing this understanding in a range of environments. From mastering theories
                    and calculations in the lecture hall, to running simulations in computer rooms, to putting your
                    knowledge into practice in laboratories, to seeing them in action during site or visit fields – it’s fair
                    to say you won’t be sitting still for long.
                    Once you’ve completed your degree, you can expect employers to be fighting for your signature. As
                    some of the best paid graduates, chemical engineers can expect to earn up to £28k straight from
                    university, making them second only to doctors.
